[W][L] No parameters just starts the program.
[W][L] Use green screen to show that the program can be re-started and is restoring settings from the master settings file.

The "--settings" allows specification of a settings file to use.  The next lexeme is the full path, enclosed in quotes if needed.

[w][L]    A settings file used in this manner should never be saved over automatically by Jynx on exiting!  [Use gedit to check]
       On Linux:     ../ForLinux/bin/Debug/Jynx --settings /home/jonathan/Documents/Jynx/Testing/test.config
       On Windows:   c:\users\jonathan\documents\work\jynx\ForWindows\Debug\Jynx.exe --settings "c:\users\jonathan\documents\work\jynx\Testing\test.config"
			[MS-windows failed because it overwrites the settings file always]

[W][L] The "--snapshot" allows auto-starting a snapshot.  The next lexeme is the full path, enclosed in quotes if needed.
       On Linux:     ../ForLinux/bin/Debug/Jynx --snapshot /home/jonathan/Documents/Jynx/Testing/DuringBACH.lynxsnapshot
       On Windows:   c:\users\jonathan\documents\work\jynx\ForWindows\Debug\Jynx.exe --snapshot "c:\users\jonathan\documents\work\jynx\Testing\DuringBACH.lynxsnapshot"

[w][L] The "--snapshot" reports a clean failure, and exits the emulator, if a non-snapshot is passed in.
       On Linux:     ../ForLinux/bin/Debug/Jynx --snapshot /home/jonathan/Documents/Jynx/Testing/Nonsense.lynxsnapshot
       On Windows:   c:\users\jonathan\documents\work\jynx\ForWindows\Debug\Jynx.exe --snapshot "c:\users\jonathan\documents\work\jynx\Testing\Nonsense.lynxsnapshot"
			[MS-windows failed with ABORT called -- exception not caught properly]

[W][L] The "--tap" allows auto-running a TAP file.  The next lexeme is the full path, enclosed in quotes if needed.
       On Linux:     ../ForLinux/bin/Debug/Jynx --run "/home/jonathan/Documents/Jynx/Testing/ALL PAPERS.tap"
       On Windows:   c:\users\jonathan\documents\work\jynx\ForWindows\Debug\Jynx.exe --run "c:\users\jonathan\documents\work\jynx\Testing\ALL PAPERS.tap"

[w][L] The "--tap" reports a clean failure, and exits the emulator, if a non-tap is passed in.
       On Linux:     ../ForLinux/bin/Debug/Jynx --run "/home/jonathan/Documents/Jynx/Testing/Nonsense.tap"
       On Windows:   c:\users\jonathan\documents\work\jynx\ForWindows\Debug\Jynx.exe --run "c:\users\jonathan\documents\work\jynx\Testing\nonsense.tap"
			[MS-windows failed with ABORT called -- exception not caught properly]

[W][L] "--snapshot" takes precedence over "--run" if both are present.
       On Linux:     ../ForLinux/bin/Debug/Jynx --run "/home/jonathan/Documents/Jynx/Testing/ALL PAPERS.tap" --snapshot /home/jonathan/Documents/Jynx/Testing/DuringBACH.lynxsnapshot

The "--games" command line switch will suppress the following prompts.
       On Linux:     ../ForLinux/bin/Debug/Jynx --games
       On Windows:   c:\users\jonathan\documents\work\jynx\ForWindows\Debug\Jynx.exe --games
[W][L] The   "Are you sure you want to close the Lynx emulator?"   prompt is never shown, and is forced to YES.
[W][L] The   "Tape rewound."   message is never displayed.  The tape is re-wound quietly.
[W][L] The   "This action will RESET the emulator!\n\nDo you wish to proceed?"   message is never displayed, and the default is taken to be YES.
